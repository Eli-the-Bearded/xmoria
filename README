   Before compiling XMoria, you must change the following path constants in
two of the header files:
config.h: MORIA_SAV
          MORIA_HOU
          MORIA_TOP
          MORIA_HELP
          MORIA_ORIG_HELP
          MORIA_WIZ_HELP
          MORIA_OWIZ_HELP
          MORIA_WELCOME
          MORIA_LOG
          MORIA_VER
xmoria.h: BITMAP_PATH
   These are vital to making XMoria run correctly, and are currently set for
MY account.  The only part of the strings that should be the same is the last
section.  Everything else depends on your account.  Failure to do this will
result in a seemingly unrelated X error in a function noone has ever heard of.
This is from when the program tries to load the bitmaps and can't find them.

   Another possible problem can be averted by typing "xmkmf" before trying to
compile.  This rebuilds the "Makefile" to include subtle differences in your
system.
